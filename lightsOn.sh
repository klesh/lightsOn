# This script is licensed under GNU GPL version 2.0 or above

# Description: Bash script that prevents the screensaver and display power
# management (DPMS) to be activated when you are watching Flash Videos
# fullscreen on Firefox and Chromium.
# Can detect mplayer and VLC when they are fullscreen too but I have disabled
# this by default.
# lightsOn.sh needs xscreensaver or kscreensaver to work.

# USAGE: Start the script with the number of seconds you want the checks
# for fullscreen to be done. Example:
# "./lightsOn.sh 120 &" will check every 120 seconds if e.g. Mplayer,
# VLC, Firefox or Chromium are fullscreen and delay screensaver and Power Management if so.
# You want the number of seconds to be ~10 seconds less than the time it takes
# your screensaver or Power Management to activate.
# If you don't pass an argument, the checks are done every 50 seconds.


# Set the variable `screensaver' to the screensaver you use.
# Valid options are:
# * xscreensaver (default)
# * kscreensaver (the KDE screensaver)
screensaver=xscreensaver

# Modify these variables if you want this script to detect if Mplayer,
# VLC or Firefox Flash Video are Fullscreen and disable
# xscreensaver/kscreensaver and PowerManagement.
mplayer_detection=true
vlc_detection=true
firefox_flash_detection=true
firefox_mplayer_detection=true
chromium_flash_detection=true
mpv_detection=true

# Set to true to be verbose, false to be quiet:
verbose=true
